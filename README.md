# New Horizon
A voxel game made in Lua using the Luanti engine to introduce unique mechanics and a world that blends fantasy and reality.

## Key differentiators

🌐 Walk around the world in a straight line and traverse the world by digging
🧱 Wall kick jump: Jump 2 blocks wall (space 2x)
🧗 Climb some walls and trees (holding space)
🪨 Throw rocks: Placing (right-click) or throwing (Q key)
🌳 Trees fall when cut down, so it's best to run
👤 Model and skin slightly similar to Hytale, but taller
🐾 A mob might spawn, but no more interactions
🏃 Run (W two times)

😮 And a few more details...
