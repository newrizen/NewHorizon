# New Horizon
Developing a game for Luanti

## Key differentiators
- Walk around the world in a straight line and traverse the world by digging
- Climb some walls and trees (holding space)
- Throw rocks (right-click - placing and Q key - throwing)
- Trees fall when cut down, so it's best to run
- Model and skin slightly similar to Hytale, but taller
- Mobs might spawn, but I'm not sure if it works properly yet
- And a few more details...

## How to Open
1. First, you need to install Luanti (PC or Android).
2. Download all the components from this repository, place them in a folder with any name, and then place it in the "games" folder within the ".minetest" folder of Luanti.
3. The icon will appear when you open Luanti. Create a world and play.
