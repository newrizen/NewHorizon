>[!IMPORTANT]
>The game is in the early stages of development, expect many bugs and incomplete features.

## Differentiators

🌐 Walk around the world in a straight line and traverse the world by digging (press V to open the map to see this better) 

🧱 Wall kick jump: Jump 2 blocks wall (space 2x)

🧗 Climb some walls and trees (holding space)

🍂 Falling on leaves and dry sand reduces damage

🪨 Throw rocks: Placing (right-click) or throwing (Q key)

🌳 Trees fall when cut down, so it's best to run

👤 Model and skin slightly similar to Hytale, but taller

🐾 A mob might spawn, but no more interactions

🏃 Run (W two times)

And a few more details...
